consider making ui separate react app

make timer
pause timer button/timer controls

make animations/graphics
transport vote description

make vote object/descriptions in backend
mark vote object if already completed

vote picking what vs what

transmit all vote data to frontend to allow for custom/random picking

custom avghans raid command force button


add ui
custom minecraft commands: avghans bitmap art / fireworks
make commands work
add clone commands build into worlds etc
