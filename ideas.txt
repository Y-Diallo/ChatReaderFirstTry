-auto random
-weighted random
-add animations to front end? maybe use obs chromakeying

-----  more medium power ones ----- 
1 min of 5s tnt ever 15 seconds
iron armor
less strong bow



----- stronger ones ----- 
gaggle of skeles
flying creepas
spawn a raid
kill raiders



CONCEPT 2

main idea will be to reach the bottom
every 15 mins I am teleported to the top

chat votes to tp me up to x amounts of blocks
spawn hoards in arenas
lock me in a room with a wither
tnt follow
--some of the previous ideas--
and more++

90s predictions, but the rarity is weighted
to make it harder to tp me fully back without a boss or something
(1/10 maybe?)

CHECKPOINT vote
spawns a lil checkpoint command block area
