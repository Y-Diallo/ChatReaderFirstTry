-add animations to front end? maybe use obs chromakeying consider redux?

-make commands work with diff minecraft names
-join multiple channels

-remove streamer check code duplication
-test auto random and random buttons

-make commands work with different streamers
-consider multiple minecraft names per twitch name
twitch name regex
/^(#)?[a-zA-Z0-9]{4,25}$/

-condense websocket on frontend and backend into one websocket

-make frontend have timEnd websocket be optional (default false)

figure out how to make the weather work everywhere

/setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:command_block 0 replace {Command:"Put your command here"}

---- out of scope but could be cool changes ----
separate minecraft server onto different service
separate chat service onto different service
separate frontend + basic backend w/ websocket on service
-----  more medium power ones ----- 
1 min of 5s tnt ever 15 seconds
iron armor
less strong bow
poison


----- stronger ones ----- 
gaggle of skeles  hoard
flying creepas  hoard
spawn raiders  hoard
kill raiders
watchers

-- funni ones
turtle squaaaa
fish fumble
strider + wardped fungus on a stick + saddle?
CONCEPT 2

main idea will be to reach the bottom
every 15 mins I am teleported to the top
bottom of the world is -60
chat votes to tp me up to x amounts of blocks
spawn hoards in arenas
lock me in a room with a wither
tnt follow
--some of the previous ideas--
and more++

RULES:
no digging straight down\

IF I FAIL I HAVE TO DO A STREAM OF PURE NEGATIVE DEBUFFS LIKE HOARDS
CLEAR INV SPAWNING BOSSES this is happening on a regualr basis
