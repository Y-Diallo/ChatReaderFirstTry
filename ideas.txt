CONCEPT 2

main idea will be to reach the bottom
every 15 mins I am teleported to the top
bottom of the world is -60
chat votes to tp me up to x amounts of blocks
spawn hoards in arenas
lock me in a room with a wither
tnt follow
--some of the previous ideas--
and more++

RULES:
no digging straight down\
IF I FAIL I HAVE TO DO A STREAM OF PURE NEGATIVE DEBUFFS LIKE HOARDS
CLEAR INV SPAWNING BOSSES this is happening on a regualr basis

90s predictions, but the rarity is weighted
to make it harder to tp me fully back without a boss or something
(1/10 maybe?)

CHECKPOINT vote
spawns a lil checkpoint command block area

CLEANUP ROOM
